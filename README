> about
lshwd - lists hardware devices and their approp modules. currently supports pci
,usb, pcmcia, and firewire devices. lshwd uses pcitable & usbtable files (can
be located at same directory or /usr/share/hwdata) for displaying extended
description and module names. module names are then parsed for generic names
and changes accordingly.

> purpose
lshwd is a simple device lister with some very handy options. ideally, its
functionality should be similiar to kudzu/hwsetup but without the lag. when used
with '-a' it should auto-load approp modules. lshwd is intended for anyone who
wants to quickly check for his hardware specific modules without too much
hastle, for quick live-cds auto-detection and configure, 1st time linux n00bs,
etc. lshwd tries to mimic the lsxxx tools family (lspci,lsusb) output when no
commandline is specified. using '-cc' option provides a more "user-friendly"
output.

> why
hmm... out of bordem? mostly for knowledge :-)
when i entered the linux world, i used hwd to identify my hardware and to direct
me to which modules i should use - this all concept was very new to me. however,
the more i used hwd, the more i got frustrated - its performance time was ~22
sec on my pc. this little anooyance was insignificant since hwd is not a
daily-use tool. however, once i considered making my own Arch-Live-CD, ~22 sec
delay at startup was too much to for me to bare... so i decided to code a new
engine for hwd - and there u have it - lshwd.

> todo
- improve mouse probe
- add cpu detection (and sensors maybe?)
- add hd info (ide/scsi/sata)

> usage
lshwd [-a] [-c] [-cc] [-d] [-id] [-m] [-n] [-ox]
  -a   auto-modprobe 
  -c   categorized output
  -cc  colorized & categorized output
  -d   display default description
  -id  display hardware id
  -m   machine readable format
  -n   no duplicates
  -ox  output X info to /tmp/xinfo (only gfx card section)

> compiling
you must have latest pciutils & usbutils packages to compile lshwd properly.
edit the Makefile if u wish, and execute make.

> files used
/usr/share/hwdata/Cards
/usr/share/hwdata/pcitable
/usr/share/hwdata/usbtable
/usr/share/hwdata/pcmciatable
/usr/share/pci.ids (from pciutils package)
/usr/share/usb.ids (from usbutils package)

we are keeping same file names and directory structure as kudzu/hwsetup, to
minimize problems on distributions other than Arch linux. see contact info
for latest files versions.
